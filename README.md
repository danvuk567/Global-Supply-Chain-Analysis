## **Objective** ##

This is a project I found on Kaggle with the following link: [DataCo SMART SUPPLY CHAIN FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS Project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis). The goal is to analyze supply chain big data to identify order-to-delivery time, sales performance and transaction processing inefficiencies. Transformations were done in Power BI Power Query to clean and normalize the data into Dimension and Fact tables. Interactive visualizations were created to display various sales and orders KPI's, product sales performance and sales transaction trends.

## **Highlights** ##

* Total sales, total profit andt otal items sold has been on a slight decline from 2015 to 2017.
* Average sales transactions per day went up in 2017.
* More than half of deliveries are late in all 3 years.
* The top selling dept in 2015 and 2017 is *Fan Shop*, 2nd is *Apparel*.
* The top selling category in 2015 and 2017 is *Fishing*, 2nd is *Cleats*.
* Most customer types were consumers vs. corporate or home office.
* Each year, most sales transactions are in progress and not completed.
* Late deliveries did not have a greater impact on completed sales transactions.
* Since September of 2017, total sales transactions have been increased while total items sold have decreased dramatically.
  This indicates that less items are being purchased more frequently towards the end of 2017.
